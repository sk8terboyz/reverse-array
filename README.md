# reverse-array

This is code from a class I took a couple years ago where all code was developed on Linux servers.

The code needs compiling, and a Binary file was in the original folder, but I am not sure if that was necessary or not (it's been awhile).

This folder also included the file "reverseOrder.txt" but that file is no longer readable on the linux servers it was on, so I'm not sure the structure it was created with.
